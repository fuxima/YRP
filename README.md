York Region Crime Analysis & Staffing Forecast
📋 Project Overview
This project presents a data-driven analysis of crime trends and staffing challenges for York Regional Police, with a focused assessment of District 4 (Vaughan). The analysis combines police data with external datasets to forecast crime patterns and identify operational vulnerabilities, providing actionable recommendations for resource allocation and strategic planning.

🎯 Business Objectives
Crime Forecasting: Predict crime trends for York Region and identify high-risk districts

Staffing Optimization: Analyze scheduling challenges and officer availability gaps

Resource Allocation: Provide data-driven recommendations for tactical deployment

📊 Key Findings
District 4 Crisis Identification
54% officer availability rate (33/61 officers)

Epicenter of crime surge: Auto theft (+268.6%), gun violence (+223.8%), organized crime (+197.0%)

Critical staffing mismatch: Peak crime on weekends vs. highest vulnerability on weekdays

Predictive Insights
Crime follows predictable patterns: Evenings, weekends, summer months (Aug-Oct peak)

Top predictive factors:

Historical crime counts (68.3%)

Day of week (18.2%)

Temperature (6.5%)

2026 forecast: 5.2% increase expected, requiring proactive measures

🛠️ Methodology
Data Sources
Primary: York Regional Police Community Safety Data Portal (2020-2025)

External Integration:

Weather data (temperature patterns)

Road safety indicators

Economic and demographic factors

Modeling Approach
Time Series Analysis: Seasonal decomposition and pattern recognition

Machine Learning: Ensemble modeling (Random Forest + Gradient Boosting)

Feature Engineering: Temporal, weather, and historical trend features

Model Performance
Ensemble Model: MAE=15.0, RMSE=18.9, R²=0.32

Strategic Interpretation: Low R² expected as model captures predictable patterns while targeted interventions address organized crime spikes
